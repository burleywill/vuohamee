Does anybody have any fix or other method for unlocking the bootloader. 
Hey guys, I'm currently dealing with this issue which Google is refusing to admit and giving me a run-around. I rma'ed my Pixel 2 due to an unrelated issue (loose charging port, charging intermittently, yes I've cleaned it) called googled support up, and they sent me a refurbished device. All was great and dandy until I tried unlocking the bootloader.

Long version: Phone was recently purchased second hand from a third-party market (Kijiji, kind of like craigslist for Canadians).

Hi, I have a Moto Z Force on Android 8.0. Today, all hardware buttons except the home button stopped working. I can no longer use the power key or volume keys. I want to restart the device to see if I've run into some freakish bug, but from what I've seen most apps are not allowed to access the power menu without root privileges. My phone is not rooted.
